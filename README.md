 Algorithms for Sequence Analysis VU Bioinformatics MSc. course

 ## dp_assignment (Dynamic Programming for Sequence alignment)
 - contains script _align.py_ that performs global (Needleman-Wunch) / semiglobal / local (Smith-Waterman) DP alignment algorithm based on user input of FASTA amino-acid sequences
 - .fasta files contain some tricky test cases all of which are successfully handled by the algorithm

## burrows_wheeler (Burrows Wheeler Transform compression for genetic sequence data)

## HMM (Hidden Markov Models for genetic sequences)
- includes native Python implementations of Viterbi, Baum-Welch, Foward, Forward-Backward HMM algorithms
